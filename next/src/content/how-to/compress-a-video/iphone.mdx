<TLDR>
Use the free [Compress Videos & Resize Video app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compress-videos-resize-video/id1473857051) or iOS Shortcuts. 

Pick **1080p, 30 fps, 4-8 Mbps** (30-60 MB per minute). 

Or just keep the full quality:

**Skip compression entirely** - send full-quality videos via Transfer.zip (no size limit, end-to-end encrypted, instant P2P sharing).
</TLDR>

## Before You Start

Check your video info in **Photos → video → i (Info)** to see size, resolution, and fps. Always duplicate the video first (**••• → Duplicate**) so you keep the original.

---

## 1) Use the Free "Compress Videos & Resize Video" App

Install [Compress Videos & Resize Video](https://apps.apple.com/app/compress-videos-resize-video/id1473857051), select your video, set resolution (1080p/720p), frame rate (30 fps), and bitrate, then compress. Quick, free, and gives you control over the final size.

---

## 2) iOS Shortcuts (built in)

Search for **"Reduce Video Size"** in the Shortcuts Gallery and add it. Run it, pick your video, and it saves a smaller copy.

For custom settings, create your own shortcut using the **Encode Media** action—set video size (1080p/720p), frame rate (30), and codec (HEVC for smaller files, H.264 for compatibility). Free, private, and repeatable.

---

## 3) Online Tools (no install)

Browser tools like [Vert.sh](https://vert.sh/), [Clideo](https://clideo.com/compress-video), or [VEED.IO](https://www.veed.io/tools/compress-video) let you upload, compress, and download without installing anything.

## 4) iMovie (free from Apple)

Create a new movie project with your clip, then **Share → Save Video** at 1080p or 720p. Simple, offline, and reliable.

## Compression Cheat Sheet

| Goal                         | Resolution | Frame rate   | Bitrate target | About size per minute |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Texts/Messaging              | 720p       | 30 fps       | 2-3 Mbps       | \~15-23 MB            |
| General sharing              | 1080p      | 30 fps       | 4-8 Mbps       | \~30-60 MB            |
| Social (Reels/TikTok/Shorts) | 1080×1920  | 30 or 60 fps | 8-12 Mbps      | \~60-90+ MB           |
| Email limits (strict)        | 720p       | 30 fps       | 1.5-2 Mbps     | \~11-15 MB            |

**Quick math**:
**MB per minute ≈ (bitrate in Mbps ÷ 8) × 60**.
Example: 6 Mbps → 0.75 MB per second → about **45 MB per minute**.

**HEVC vs H.264**

* **HEVC (H.265)**: smaller files, best for Apple devices. Some older devices may not play it.
* **H.264**: works almost everywhere, but files are a bit bigger.

---

## Quality Tips

* **60 fps → 30 fps** to cut size fast.
* **Use 1080p instead of 4K** unless you truly need 4K.
* **Turn off HDR** before recording if you plan to share widely.
* **Trim first** in Photos to remove parts you do not need.
* **Crop or straighten** to remove extra edges.
* **Keep the camera steady**. Shaky video needs more data to look good.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Lots of motion or tiny details** (sports, water, grass) need a higher bitrate.
* **Very dark clips** can look noisy; raise bitrate a little.
* **Audio too big**: use AAC at **128-192 kbps**.
* **HDR/10-bit** footage can be large; export to standard **SDR/8-bit** if you can.
* **Zipping did nothing**: re-encode with the app or a Shortcut instead.

---

## Keep or Delete the Original

* Compare the new file with the old one. If happy, you can delete the original to save space.
* If you use **iCloud Photos**, deleting on your iPhone deletes it everywhere. Save a copy to **Files** or another cloud first if you want to keep it.

---

## Privacy and Sharing

* **AirDrop** or a **cloud link** keeps full quality.
* **Messaging apps** may shrink your video again. Send a link if quality matters.
* Do not upload private videos to online tools.

---

## Record Smaller Next Time

* **Settings → Camera → Formats → High Efficiency** (HEVC).
* **Settings → Camera → Record Video → 1080p at 30 fps**.
* Turn off **HDR Video** if you share to older or mixed devices.
* Use **Auto FPS** to keep low-light files smaller.

## FAQs

**Will compressing lower quality?**
Yes, a little. That is normal. Keep the original until you are sure.

**What if someone cannot play HEVC?**
Export as **H.264** or share a cloud link so they can download and convert.

**Where is my compressed file?**
With apps: usually in **Photos**. With Shortcuts: in **Photos** or **Files**, depending on what you chose.

**Tip:** Trim extra parts in the Photos app before compressing to save more space.
