<TLDR>
Email limits videos to 20-25 MB, but most phone videos exceed 100 MB. 

What you can do: 

1. **Trim first**, you probably don't need to send the whole video.

2. Compress to 480p-720p using HandBrake or online tools like Vert.sh. 

For videos over 2 minutes or high quality needs, skip compression and send a link instead, with [Transfer.zip](https://Transfer.zip).
</TLDR>

## Understanding Email Attachment Limits

Email providers impose strict file size limits:

| Email Provider | Attachment Size Limit |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Gmail** | 25 MB |
| **Outlook/Hotmail** | 20 MB |
| **Yahoo Mail** | 25 MB |
| **Apple Mail (iCloud)** | 20 MB |

Most videos recorded on modern phones far exceed these limits. A minute of 4K video can be **375 MB**, while 1080p video averages **130 MB per minute**. You need significant compression to email videos.

<Info>
Videos often require compression to fit email limits. A 2-minute 1080p video can be 260 MB, which is 10x over Gmail's 25 MB limit.

## Quick Answer: Best Settings for Email

For most email attachments, aim for:

- **Resolution:** 480p (854×480) or 720p (1280×720)
- **Bitrate:** 1-3 Mbps
- **Codec:** H.264 (most compatible)
- **Frame rate:** 30 fps
- **Target size:** Under 20 MB

**Example:** A 2-minute video at 480p, 1 Mbps = approximately 15 MB ✓

## Method 1: Trim Your Video First (Most Effective)

Before compressing, remove unnecessary footage. This drastically reduces file size.

- **Windows:** Photos app → Edit video → Trim
- **Mac:** QuickTime → Edit → Trim
- **iPhone:** Photos → Edit → drag timeline edges
- **Android:** Google Photos → Edit → Crop

<Tip>
Trimming a 5-minute video to 1 minute is far more effective than any compression technique. Always trim first before compressing.

## Method 2: Online Compression Tools (Easiest)

Online compressors are simple and require no software installation.

**Recommended Tools:**

- **[Vert.sh](https://vert.sh/)** — Free, no watermark. Use the "Email" preset or set resolution to 480p/720p manually.
- **[FreeConvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor)** — Upload up to 1 GB, set target size to 15-20 MB.

## Method 3: Desktop Software (Best Control)

For frequent compression or offline work, desktop software gives better results.

### HandBrake (Free, Windows/Mac/Linux)

Download [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/), open your video, and use the **Fast 480p30** or **Fast 720p30** preset. For email, aim for RF 24-28 or 1500 kbps bitrate. Target: ~10-15 MB per minute.

### VLC Media Player (Free)

Use [VLC's](https://www.videolan.org/) **Media → Convert/Save**, select the H.264 profile, and set bitrate to 1500 kbps.

---

## Method 4: Send a Link Instead (Recommended)

If compression isn't getting you below the limit, send a download link to preserve quality.

- **[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)** — Unlimited size, end-to-end encrypted. Copy link and paste in email.
- **[SwissTransfer](https://swisstransfer.com)** — Up to 50 GB, files stored 30 days.
- **Cloud Storage** — Google Drive (15 GB), Dropbox (2 GB), OneDrive (5 GB). Upload, share, copy link.

**Gmail tip:** Files over 25 MB automatically upload to Google Drive and insert a link.

## Quality vs. Size Tradeoffs

| Setting | Impact on File Size | Impact on Quality |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lower resolution (1080p→480p) | Dramatic (up to 75%) | Noticeable but acceptable on small screens |
| Lower bitrate (8→1 Mbps) | Proportional reduction | Visible compression artifacts |
| Trim video length (5 min→2 min) | Proportional reduction | No quality loss |

**Best approach:** Combine techniques: Trim + reduce to 720p + lower bitrate to 2 Mbps.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always keep the original** - Make a copy before compressing
2. **Test before sending** - Play compressed video to check quality
3. **Name files clearly** - "ProjectDemo_Compressed.mp4"
4. **Mention in email** - "Video attached (compressed for email)"
5. **Compress for mobile** - Most people view on phones where 480p-720p looks fine
6. **Use H.264 codec** - Most compatible across devices

<Alert>
**For sensitive videos:**
- Never upload to free online tools
- Use offline software like HandBrake
- Or use encrypted transfer services like Transfer.zip
</Alert>

## Common Issues

**"Email won't send"**
→ Video still too large. Compress more or send a link instead

**"Quality looks terrible"**
→ Compressed too much. Increase bitrate or send link to full-quality video

**"Recipient can't play video"**
→ Use H.264 codec and export as .mp4 (most universal)

**"Compression taking forever"**
→ Large videos take time. Try trimming first to reduce processing

## FAQ

**What's the best resolution for email videos?**
480p is ideal - clear enough for laptops and phones while staying under size limits.

**Can I compress without software?**
Yes, use online tools like Vert.sh or FreeConvert that work in your browser.

**Why is my video still huge after zipping?**
Videos are already compressed. Zipping provides minimal compression (5-10%). You need to re-encode the video.

**What codec should I use?**
H.264 is most compatible. Avoid H.265/HEVC unless recipients have modern devices.

## Summary

- **Casual sharing:** Trim first, compress to 480p with Vert.sh, attach if under 20 MB.
- **Best quality:** Use HandBrake at 720p, RF 24, 2 Mbps.
- **Videos that won't fit:** Upload to [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip) and paste the link in your email.

**Bottom line:** Email wasn't designed for large video files. For videos over 2 minutes or high quality, skip compression and use a file transfer service. Your recipients will appreciate better quality.
