<TLDR>
Email limits videos to 20-25 MB, but most phone videos exceed 100 MB. 

What you can do: 

1. **Trim first**, you probably don't need to send the whole video.

2. Compress to 480p-720p using HandBrake or online tools like Vert.sh. 

For videos over 2 minutes or high quality needs, skip compression and send a link instead, with [Transfer.zip](https://Transfer.zip).
</TLDR>

## Understanding Email Attachment Limits

Email providers impose strict file size limits:

| Email Provider | Attachment Size Limit |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Gmail** | 25 MB |
| **Outlook/Hotmail** | 20 MB |
| **Yahoo Mail** | 25 MB |
| **Apple Mail (iCloud)** | 20 MB |

Most videos recorded on modern phones far exceed these limits. A minute of 4K video can be **375 MB**, while 1080p video averages **130 MB per minute**. You need significant compression to email videos.

<Info>
Videos often require compression to fit email limits. A 2-minute 1080p video can be 260 MB, which is 10x over Gmail's 25 MB limit.

## Quick Answer: Best Settings for Email

For most email attachments, aim for:

- **Resolution:** 480p (854×480) or 720p (1280×720)
- **Bitrate:** 1-3 Mbps
- **Codec:** H.264 (most compatible)
- **Frame rate:** 30 fps
- **Target size:** Under 20 MB

**Example:** A 2-minute video at 480p, 1 Mbps = approximately 15 MB ✓

## Method 1: Trim Your Video First (Most Effective)

Before compressing, remove unnecessary footage. This drastically reduces file size.

**Windows 11 (Photos App):**
1. Right-click video → **Open with** → **Photos**
2. Click **Edit video** → **Trim**
3. Drag sliders to keep essential parts
4. Click **Save a copy**

**Mac (QuickTime):**
1. Open video in **QuickTime Player**
2. **Edit** → **Trim**
3. Drag handles to select portion to keep
4. **File** → **Export As** → choose quality

**iPhone:**
1. Open video in **Photos**
2. Tap **Edit** → **Crop icon**
3. Drag timeline edges to trim
4. Tap **Done** → **Save as New Clip**

**Android:**
1. Open **Google Photos**
2. Select video → **Edit** → **Crop**
3. Adjust start/end points
4. **Save copy**

<Tip>
Trimming a 5-minute video to 1 minute is far more effective than any compression technique. Always trim first before compressing.

## Method 2: Online Compression Tools (Easiest)

Online compressors are simple and require no software installation.

**Recommended Tools:**

**[Vert.sh](https://vert.sh/)** (Free, no watermark)
1. Visit Vert.sh → **Choose File**
2. Select **Email** preset or custom:
   - Resolution: **480p** or **720p**
   - Quality: **Low to Medium**
3. Click **Compress Video**
4. Download and attach to email

**[FreeConvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor)** (Free)
1. Upload video (up to 1 GB)
2. Choose **Target Size:** enter 15-20 MB
3. Click **Compress Now**
4. Download compressed file

**Pros:** No installation, works on any device, beginner-friendly
**Cons:** Requires internet, privacy concerns for sensitive videos

## Method 3: Desktop Software (Best Control)

For frequent compression or offline work, desktop software gives better results.

### HandBrake (Free, Windows/Mac/Linux)

HandBrake is the gold standard for video compression:

1. Download [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
2. **Open Source** → select your video
3. **Presets** → select **Fast 480p30** or **Fast 720p30**
4. Click **Video** tab:
   - Codec: **H.264 (x264)**
   - Quality: **RF 24-28** (higher = smaller file)
   - Or set **Avg Bitrate** to **1500 kbps**
5. Click **Start Encode**

**Target settings:** 480p, RF 26, 1-1.5 Mbps = ~10-15 MB per minute

### VLC Media Player (Free)

1. Open [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)
2. **Media** → **Convert/Save**
3. **Add** your video → **Convert/Save**
4. Profile: **Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)**
5. Click **Settings** icon:
   - Bitrate: **1500 kb/s**
   - Frame rate: **30**
6. **Save** → Choose location → **Start**

## Method 4: Send a Link Instead (Recommended)

If compression isn't getting you below the limit, send a download link to preserve quality.

**[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)** (Unlimited, Free)
- Select "Quick Transfer" → Choose video
- Copy link → Paste in email body
- No file size limits, end-to-end encrypted

**[SwissTransfer](https://swisstransfer.com)** (Up to 50 GB)
- Upload video → Get shareable link
- Files stored for 30 days

**Cloud Storage:**
- **Google Drive** (15 GB free): Upload → Share → Copy link
- **Dropbox** (2 GB free): Upload → Share → Copy link
- **OneDrive** (5 GB free): Upload → Share → Copy link

**Gmail tip:** Gmail automatically uploads files over 25 MB to Google Drive and inserts a link.

## Quality vs. Size Tradeoffs

| Setting | Impact on File Size | Impact on Quality |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lower resolution (1080p→480p) | Dramatic (up to 75%) | Noticeable but acceptable on small screens |
| Lower bitrate (8→1 Mbps) | Proportional reduction | Visible compression artifacts |
| Trim video length (5 min→2 min) | Proportional reduction | No quality loss |

**Best approach:** Combine techniques: Trim + reduce to 720p + lower bitrate to 2 Mbps.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always keep the original** - Make a copy before compressing
2. **Test before sending** - Play compressed video to check quality
3. **Name files clearly** - "ProjectDemo_Compressed.mp4"
4. **Mention in email** - "Video attached (compressed for email)"
5. **Compress for mobile** - Most people view on phones where 480p-720p looks fine
6. **Use H.264 codec** - Most compatible across devices

<Alert>
**For sensitive videos:**
- Never upload to free online tools
- Use offline software like HandBrake
- Or use encrypted transfer services like Transfer.zip
</Alert>

## Common Issues

**"Email won't send"**
→ Video still too large. Compress more or send a link instead

**"Quality looks terrible"**
→ Compressed too much. Increase bitrate or send link to full-quality video

**"Recipient can't play video"**
→ Use H.264 codec and export as .mp4 (most universal)

**"Compression taking forever"**
→ Large videos take time. Try trimming first to reduce processing

## FAQ

**What's the best resolution for email videos?**
480p is ideal - clear enough for laptops and phones while staying under size limits.

**Can I compress without software?**
Yes, use online tools like Vert.sh or FreeConvert that work in your browser.

**Why is my video still huge after zipping?**
Videos are already compressed. Zipping provides minimal compression (5-10%). You need to re-encode the video.

**What codec should I use?**
H.264 is most compatible. Avoid H.265/HEVC unless recipients have modern devices.

## Summary

**For casual sharing:**
1. Trim video to essentials
2. Use Vert.sh or FreeConvert to compress to 480p
3. Attach to email if under 20 MB

**For best quality:**
1. Install HandBrake
2. Use 720p, RF 24, 2 Mbps settings
3. Test file size and adjust

**For videos that won't fit:**
1. Upload to [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip) (unlimited size)
2. Copy link and paste in email body
3. Note: "Video too large for attachment - click to download"

**Bottom line:** Email wasn't designed for large video files. For videos over 2 minutes or high quality, skip compression and use a file transfer service. Your recipients will appreciate better quality.
