<TLDR>
Online tools like [Vert.sh](https://vert.sh) (open source, no install needed).

For offline use, try **[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)**, a free desktop app.

For large videos **without quality loss**, share via Transfer.zip instead &rarr; unlimited size, no compression needed.
</TLDR>

## Why Compress Video Files?

Modern cameras and smartphones record videos in stunning quality—4K, 60fps, HDR—but this comes at a cost: massive file sizes. A single minute of 4K video can exceed **375 MB**, making it impractical to email, upload, or share quickly. Video compression reduces file size while preserving acceptable quality, making videos easier to:

- Email (most providers limit to 20-25 MB)
- Upload to websites and social media
- Store on devices with limited space
- Share over slow internet connections
- Text or message (Discord: 25 MB, WhatsApp: 16 MB)

**The tradeoff:** Smaller file size means some quality loss. The key is finding the right balance for your use case.

---

## Method 2: Desktop Software (Best Control & Quality)

Desktop applications give you precise control over compression settings and work offline. Recommended for frequent video compression.

### HandBrake (Free, Open Source)

**Platform:** Windows, Mac, Linux

The gold standard for video compression. Download from [handbrake.fr](https://handbrake.fr/), open your video, and select a preset like **Fast 480p30** (email), **Fast 720p30** (web), or **Fast 1080p30** (YouTube).

For more control, adjust the **Video tab**: use H.264/H.265 codec, set quality RF 23-28 (lower = better quality), or specify a target bitrate. Audio should stay at AAC 128-192 kbps.

**Tips:**
- Use the **Queue** to batch process multiple videos
- Save custom presets for recurring settings
- Check **Web Optimized** for faster online streaming
- Use **Preview** to test settings before full encode

---

### VLC Media Player (Free, Quick & Simple)

**Platform:** Windows, Mac, Linux

Most people have [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) for playing videos, but it can also compress. Use **Media → Convert/Save**, select the H.264 profile, and adjust bitrate (1500-5000 kbps) or scale (0.5 halves resolution) as needed.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Already installed on most computers</Pro>
<Pro>Simple</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">
<Con>Less control than HandBrake</Con>
<Con>Slower encoding</Con>
</BadFor>

---

### FFmpeg (Command Line, Advanced Users)

**Platform:** Windows, Mac, Linux

FFmpeg is the underlying engine most video tools use. Direct CLI access for maximum power.

**Basic compression command:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -vf scale=1280:720 -acodec aac -b:a 128k output.mp4
```

**What it does:**
- `-vcodec libx264`: Use H.264 codec
- `-crf 23`: Quality (lower = better, 18-28 recommended)
- `-preset medium`: Encoding speed (slower = better compression)
- `-vf scale=1280:720`: Resize to 720p
- `-acodec aac -b:a 128k`: Audio at 128 kbps

**Target specific file size:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 2M -maxrate 2M -bufsize 1M output.mp4
```

### Windows Built-in Tools

**Clipchamp (Windows 11):** Pre-installed editor. Import video, export at 480p/720p/1080p with your choice of quality level.

**Photos App (Windows 10/11):** Open video in Photos, use **Edit & Create → Trim** to cut unnecessary parts, then save a copy.

---

## Method 3: Compress Videos on Mobile

### iPhone & iPad

See our comprehensive guide: [How to compress a video on iPhone](/how-to/compress-a-video/iphone)

**Quick options:**
1. **Shortcuts app (built-in, free):**
   - Gallery → "Reduce Video Size" → Add
   - Run on any video from Photos
2. **Compress Videos & Resize Video app:**
   - Install from App Store (free)
   - Choose video, set resolution/bitrate, compress

---

### Android

**Video Compressor - Fast Compress** and **VidCompact** are popular free apps from the Play Store. Both let you select a video, choose a quality preset (Low/Normal/High or custom resolution), and save the compressed result to your gallery.

---

## Method 4: Trim & Cut Videos (Often Most Effective)

Sometimes the best compression is simply making the video shorter by removing unnecessary parts. A 5-minute video trimmed to 1 minute is 80% smaller—better than any codec can achieve.

- **Windows:** Photos app → Edit video → Trim
- **Mac:** QuickTime → Edit → Trim (Cmd+T)
- **iPhone:** Photos → Edit → drag timeline edges
- **Android:** Google Photos → Edit → Crop

---

## Advanced Compression Techniques

### Two-Pass Encoding
For best quality at a target bitrate:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 3M -pass 1 -f mp4 /dev/null
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 3M -pass 2 output.mp4
```

### Change Codec to H.265
H.265 (HEVC) provides 30-50% better compression:
- **HandBrake:** Video tab → Encoder: H.265
- **FFmpeg:** `-vcodec libx265`

**Warning:** Older devices may not play H.265 videos.

### Remove Audio
If audio isn't needed (e.g., screencasts with voiceover added later):
- **HandBrake:** Audio tab → Remove all tracks
- **FFmpeg:** `-an` flag

### Reduce Frame Rate
If smoothness isn't critical:
- Reduce 60fps → 30fps saves 40-50%
- **HandBrake:** Video tab → Framerate: 30

## Comparison: Which Method to Use?

| Situation | Best Method | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **One-time quick compression** | Online tools (Vert.sh, Clideo) | No installation, simple presets |
| **Frequent compression** | HandBrake | Best quality control, free, offline |
| **Batch compress many videos** | HandBrake queue or FFmpeg | Efficient bulk processing |
| **Mobile device** | Shortcuts (iPhone) or VidCompact (Android) | Built-in or simple apps |
| **Professional work** | HandBrake or FFmpeg | Maximum control over settings |
| **Quick size reduction** | Trim/cut video first | Most effective method |
| **Super small files needed** | HandBrake with H.265, low bitrate | Best compression available |

---

## Quality vs. File Size Tradeoffs

Understanding what you sacrifice for smaller files:

| Change | Quality Impact | File Size Reduction |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 4K → 1080p | Noticeable on large screens, fine on laptops/phones | 60-70% |
| 1080p → 720p | Slight quality loss, acceptable for most uses | 50-60% |
| 720p → 480p | Visible quality loss, OK for small screens | 40-50% |
| 60fps → 30fps | Slight smoothness loss, barely noticeable | 40-50% |
| Bitrate cut in half | Compression artifacts, blockiness | 50% |
| H.264 → H.265 | No visible loss | 30-50% (but less compatible) |
| Trim 50% of video | No quality loss | 50% |

**Best strategy:** Combine multiple small changes rather than one drastic change.
Example: 1080p 60fps 10Mbps → 720p 30fps 3Mbps = 75% smaller with acceptable quality.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Video quality is too poor after compression"**
- You compressed too aggressively. Increase bitrate or resolution
- Use a better encoder (HandBrake vs. online tools)
- Try H.265 codec for better quality at same file size

**"File size didn't reduce much"**
- Video was already heavily compressed
- Try reducing resolution, not just bitrate
- Trim video length instead
- Use H.265 codec

**"Compressed video won't play on some devices"**
- You used H.265 (HEVC) which isn't universally supported
- Re-encode with H.264 for maximum compatibility
- Or export as .mp4 with H.264

**"Compression is taking forever"**
- Large files and slow presets take time
- Use "Fast" or "Very Fast" preset in HandBrake
- Close other applications
- For urgent needs, use online tools with faster servers

**"Video looks pixelated/blocky"**
- Bitrate is too low for the amount of motion/detail
- Increase bitrate
- Use 2-pass encoding for better quality
- Reduce resolution instead of lowering bitrate further

**"Colors look washed out after compression"**
- Color space mismatch
- In HandBrake: Video tab → set Color space to match source
- Usually bt709 for HD content

## Best Practices

1. **Always keep the original:** Compress a copy, never the original file
2. **Test before bulk processing:** Compress one video first, check quality, adjust settings if needed
3. **Name files clearly:** `Video_Original.mp4` and `Video_Compressed_720p.mp4`
4. **Match resolution to use case:** Don't compress to 480p if recipient will watch on a TV
5. **Audio matters:** Don't over-compress audio; 128-192 kbps AAC is good balance
6. **Check file size limits:** Discord: 25 MB, WhatsApp: 16 MB, Email: 20-25 MB
7. **Preview before sharing:** Watch the compressed video to ensure acceptable quality

---

## When NOT to Compress

Don't compress videos for:
- **Professional video editing:** Keep maximum quality until final export
- **Archival purposes:** Store originals in full quality
- **Future use:** You can always compress later; can't restore lost quality
- **When sharing via unlimited services:** Use Transfer.zip to send full-quality files

---

## Alternative: Send Full-Quality Videos

Instead of compressing, consider sending the original via:

**[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)** (Unlimited size, P2P)
- No file size limits with Quick Transfer
- No upload wait time (streams directly)
- End-to-end encrypted
- Free forever

**Cloud Storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Store once, share link
- Recipients can stream without downloading
- Good for recurring access

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the best codec for video compression?**
H.264 for compatibility, H.265 (HEVC) for better compression if devices support it.

**How much can I compress a video without losing quality?**
You always lose some quality. Aim for 720p at 3-5 Mbps for good balance—most viewers won't notice the difference from 1080p.

**Can I compress videos without software?**
Yes, use online tools like Vert.sh or Clideo. They work in your browser with no installation.

**Why is my compressed video file larger than the original?**
You likely increased quality settings or used an inefficient codec. Make sure you're reducing resolution/bitrate.

**What's better: lower resolution or lower bitrate?**
Lower resolution usually looks better than very low bitrate. 720p at 3 Mbps beats 1080p at 1.5 Mbps.

**How long does video compression take?**
Depends on video length, quality, and your computer. A 10-minute 1080p video might take 5-20 minutes on an average computer.

**Will zipping a video compress it?**
No. Videos are already compressed. Zipping saves 0-5% at most. You need to re-encode the video.

**Can I compress 4K video to 1080p?**
Yes, this is one of the most effective compression techniques, reducing file size by 60-70%.
