<TLDR>
Online tools like [Vert.sh](https://vert.sh) (open source, no install needed).

For offline use, try **[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)**, a free desktop app.

For large videos **without quality loss**, share via Transfer.zip instead &rarr; unlimited size, no compression needed.
</TLDR>

## Why Compress Video Files?

Modern cameras and smartphones record videos in stunning quality—4K, 60fps, HDR—but this comes at a cost: massive file sizes. A single minute of 4K video can exceed **375 MB**, making it impractical to email, upload, or share quickly. Video compression reduces file size while preserving acceptable quality, making videos easier to:

- Email (most providers limit to 20-25 MB)
- Upload to websites and social media
- Store on devices with limited space
- Share over slow internet connections
- Text or message (Discord: 25 MB, WhatsApp: 16 MB)

**The tradeoff:** Smaller file size means some quality loss. The key is finding the right balance for your use case.

## Understanding Video Compression Basics

Before diving into methods, understand these key concepts:

### Resolution
The dimensions of your video in pixels:
- **4K (3840×2160)**: Massive files, best for professional work
- **1080p (1920×1080)**: High quality, good for most uses
- **720p (1280×720)**: Medium quality, excellent for web sharing
- **480p (854×480)**: Lower quality, great for email and messaging

**Impact:** Reducing from 4K to 1080p can reduce file size by 60-70%.

### Bitrate
The amount of data per second of video (measured in Mbps):
- **Higher bitrate** = better quality, larger file
- **Lower bitrate** = worse quality, smaller file

**Typical bitrates:**
- 4K video: 35-100 Mbps
- 1080p video: 8-16 Mbps
- 720p video: 5-10 Mbps
- 480p video: 2.5-4 Mbps

### Frame Rate (fps)
How many frames per second:
- **60 fps**: Very smooth, larger files (gaming, sports)
- **30 fps**: Standard, good balance
- **24 fps**: Cinematic, smallest files

**Impact:** Reducing 60fps to 30fps cuts file size by 40-50%.

### Codec
The algorithm used to encode/decode video:
- **H.264 (AVC)**: Universal compatibility, standard compression
- **H.265 (HEVC)**: 30-50% smaller than H.264, less compatible
- **VP9**: Google's codec, used by YouTube
- **AV1**: Newest, best compression, limited support

**Recommendation:** Use H.264 for maximum compatibility.

## Quick Compression Settings Reference

Use these settings based on your goal:

| Purpose | Resolution | Bitrate | Frame Rate | Expected Size per Minute |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Email attachment** | 480p | 1.5-2 Mbps | 30 fps | ~15 MB |
| **Messaging apps** | 720p | 2-3 Mbps | 30 fps | ~20 MB |
| **Social media** | 1080p | 5-8 Mbps | 30 fps | ~50 MB |
| **YouTube upload** | 1080p | 8-12 Mbps | 30-60 fps | ~75 MB |
| **Web hosting** | 720p | 3-5 Mbps | 30 fps | ~30 MB |
| **Archive/storage** | 1080p | 10-15 Mbps | Original | ~90 MB |

## Advanced Compression Techniques

### Two-Pass Encoding
For best quality at a target bitrate:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 3M -pass 1 -f mp4 /dev/null
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 3M -pass 2 output.mp4
```

### Change Codec to H.265
H.265 (HEVC) provides 30-50% better compression:
- **HandBrake:** Video tab → Encoder: H.265
- **FFmpeg:** `-vcodec libx265`

**Warning:** Older devices may not play H.265 videos.

### Remove Audio
If audio isn't needed (e.g., screencasts with voiceover added later):
- **HandBrake:** Audio tab → Remove all tracks
- **FFmpeg:** `-an` flag

### Reduce Frame Rate
If smoothness isn't critical:
- Reduce 60fps → 30fps saves 40-50%
- **HandBrake:** Video tab → Framerate: 30

## Quality vs. File Size Tradeoffs

Understanding what you sacrifice for smaller files:

| Change | Quality Impact | File Size Reduction |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 4K → 1080p | Noticeable on large screens, fine on laptops/phones | 60-70% |
| 1080p → 720p | Slight quality loss, acceptable for most uses | 50-60% |
| 720p → 480p | Visible quality loss, OK for small screens | 40-50% |
| 60fps → 30fps | Slight smoothness loss, barely noticeable | 40-50% |
| Bitrate cut in half | Compression artifacts, blockiness | 50% |
| H.264 → H.265 | No visible loss | 30-50% (but less compatible) |
| Trim 50% of video | No quality loss | 50% |

**Best strategy:** Combine multiple small changes rather than one drastic change.
Example: 1080p 60fps 10Mbps → 720p 30fps 3Mbps = 75% smaller with acceptable quality.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Video quality is too poor after compression"**
- You compressed too aggressively. Increase bitrate or resolution
- Use a better encoder (HandBrake vs. online tools)
- Try H.265 codec for better quality at same file size

**"File size didn't reduce much"**
- Video was already heavily compressed
- Try reducing resolution, not just bitrate
- Trim video length instead
- Use H.265 codec

**"Compressed video won't play on some devices"**
- You used H.265 (HEVC) which isn't universally supported
- Re-encode with H.264 for maximum compatibility
- Or export as .mp4 with H.264

**"Compression is taking forever"**
- Large files and slow presets take time
- Use "Fast" or "Very Fast" preset in HandBrake
- Close other applications
- For urgent needs, use online tools with faster servers

**"Video looks pixelated/blocky"**
- Bitrate is too low for the amount of motion/detail
- Increase bitrate
- Use 2-pass encoding for better quality
- Reduce resolution instead of lowering bitrate further

**"Colors look washed out after compression"**
- Color space mismatch
- In HandBrake: Video tab → set Color space to match source
- Usually bt709 for HD content

## Best Practices

1. **Always keep the original:** Compress a copy, never the original file
2. **Test before bulk processing:** Compress one video first, check quality, adjust settings if needed
3. **Name files clearly:** `Video_Original.mp4` and `Video_Compressed_720p.mp4`
4. **Match resolution to use case:** Don't compress to 480p if recipient will watch on a TV
5. **Audio matters:** Don't over-compress audio; 128-192 kbps AAC is good balance
6. **Check file size limits:** Discord: 25 MB, WhatsApp: 16 MB, Email: 20-25 MB
7. **Preview before sharing:** Watch the compressed video to ensure acceptable quality

---

## When NOT to Compress

Don't compress videos for:
- **Professional video editing:** Keep maximum quality until final export
- **Archival purposes:** Store originals in full quality
- **Future use:** You can always compress later; can't restore lost quality
- **When sharing via unlimited services:** Use Transfer.zip to send full-quality files

---

## Alternative: Send Full-Quality Videos

Instead of compressing, consider sending the original via:

**[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)** (Unlimited size, P2P)
- No file size limits with Quick Transfer
- No upload wait time (streams directly)
- End-to-end encrypted
- Free forever

**Cloud Storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Store once, share link
- Recipients can stream without downloading
- Good for recurring access

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the best codec for video compression?**
H.264 for compatibility, H.265 (HEVC) for better compression if devices support it.

**How much can I compress a video without losing quality?**
You always lose some quality. Aim for 720p at 3-5 Mbps for good balance—most viewers won't notice the difference from 1080p.

**Can I compress videos without software?**
Yes, use online tools like Vert.sh or Clideo. They work in your browser with no installation.

**Why is my compressed video file larger than the original?**
You likely increased quality settings or used an inefficient codec. Make sure you're reducing resolution/bitrate.

**What's better: lower resolution or lower bitrate?**
Lower resolution usually looks better than very low bitrate. 720p at 3 Mbps beats 1080p at 1.5 Mbps.

**How long does video compression take?**
Depends on video length, quality, and your computer. A 10-minute 1080p video might take 5-20 minutes on an average computer.

**Will zipping a video compress it?**
No. Videos are already compressed. Zipping saves 0-5% at most. You need to re-encode the video.

**Can I compress 4K video to 1080p?**
Yes, this is one of the most effective compression techniques, reducing file size by 60-70%.
