<TLDR>
Best free services for large files: **Transfer.zip** (unlimited P2P, instant, no wait), **SwissTransfer** (50 GB, 30 days, no account), **WeTransfer** (3 GB, 7 days), **Google Drive** (15 GB total, permanent). For files over 50 GB or instant sharing, Transfer.zip's P2P mode is unmatched—end-to-end encrypted, no upload time, unlimited size.
</TLDR>

Email limits attachments to 20-25 MB, but modern work requires sharing much larger files like 4K videos (10-100 GB), design files (500 MB - 5 GB), or software archives (1-50 GB). Paid services charge $10-30/month, but several free options exist that match or exceed paid features.
