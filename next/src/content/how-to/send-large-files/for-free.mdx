<TLDR>
**Transfer.zip** (1 TB, 365 days, 7-day free trial - fast transfers) - **Best Choice**

**SwissTransfer** (50 GB, 30 days - slow uploads/downloads)

**WeTransfer** (3 GB, 7 days - advertisements)

**Google Drive** (15 GB total, permanent - slow uploads)
</TLDR>

Email limits attachments to 20-25 MB, but modern work requires sharing much larger files like 4K videos (10-100 GB), design files (500 MB - 5 GB), or software archives (1-50 GB). Paid services charge $10-30/month, but several free options exist that match or exceed paid features.
