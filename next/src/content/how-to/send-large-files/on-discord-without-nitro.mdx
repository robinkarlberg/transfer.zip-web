<TLDR>
Discord free tier limits uploads to **10 MB**. To send larger files: use **Transfer.zip** (unlimited P2P, instant link), **SwissTransfer** (50 GB, 30 days), or **WeTransfer** (3 GB). Just upload, copy the link, and paste it in Discord. For videos/images, compress first if quality loss is acceptable. Avoid splitting files—it's tedious for recipients.
</TLDR>

## Discord File Size Limits Explained

Discord's upload limits depend on your subscription level:

- **Free accounts**: 10 MB per file (recently decreased from 25 MB)
- **Nitro Basic**: 50 MB per file
- **Nitro**: 500 MB per file

<Info>
If you're on the free tier and need to send files larger than 10 MB, you have several effective workarounds that don't require paying for Nitro.

## Method 1: Use a File Transfer Service (Recommended)

The easiest solution is to upload your file to a transfer service, then share the download link in Discord. This works for files of any size and keeps Discord chat clean.

### Best Services for Discord File Sharing:

**[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)** - Unlimited file size (P2P mode)
- No sign-up required for Quick Transfer
- Files stream directly from your device (no upload wait)
- End-to-end encrypted for privacy
- Link expires when you close the tab (or up to 1 year with paid plans)

**Steps:**
1. Visit [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)
2. Select "Quick Transfer" and choose your file
3. Copy the generated link
4. Paste the link in your Discord chat
5. Recipients click the link to download instantly

**[SwissTransfer](https://swisstransfer.com)** - Up to 50 GB
- No account needed
- Files stored for 30 days
- Optional password protection
- Swiss privacy laws apply

**[WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com)** - Up to 3 GB (free tier)
- Simple interface
- Files stored for 3 days
- 10 transfers per month limit

## Method 2: Compress Your Files

Compression can significantly reduce file size, especially for documents, images, and certain video formats.

### For Any File Type:

**Windows:**
1. Right-click the file → **Send to** → **Compressed (zipped) folder**
2. Upload the .zip file to Discord

**Mac:**
1. Right-click the file → **Compress "[filename]"**
2. Upload the .zip file to Discord

**For Better Compression:**
- Download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Windows) or [Keka](https://www.keka.io/) (Mac)
- Right-click → 7-Zip/Keka → **Add to archive**
- Choose **.7z** format and set compression to **Ultra** or **Maximum**
- This can reduce file size by 30-70% depending on file type

### For Videos Specifically:

Videos can often be compressed dramatically without visible quality loss:

1. Use [Vert.sh](https://vert.sh/), [Clideo](https://clideo.com/compress-video), or [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
2. Reduce resolution to 720p or 1080p
3. Lower bitrate to 2-6 Mbps
4. Use H.264 or H.265 (HEVC) codec
5. Export and upload to Discord

**Example:** A 100 MB 4K video can often compress to under 25 MB at 1080p.

## Method 3: Split Large Files into Parts

If compression isn't enough, split your file into smaller chunks that fit Discord's limit.

### Using 7-Zip (Windows/Mac/Linux):

1. Download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
2. Right-click your file → **7-Zip** → **Add to archive**
3. Under **Split to volumes**, enter: `20M` (for 20 MB parts, staying under 25 MB limit)
4. Click **OK**
5. Upload each part (file.7z.001, file.7z.002, etc.) to Discord
6. Recipients download all parts, then extract using 7-Zip

<Warning>
**Important:** Recipients need ALL parts in the same folder to extract. Make sure they download every part before trying to extract.
</Warning>

### Using WinRAR:

1. Right-click file → **Add to archive**
2. Set **Split to volumes** to `20M`
3. Create archive and upload each part

---

## Method 4: Use Cloud Storage Links

Upload to your existing cloud storage and share the link in Discord.

### Google Drive:
1. Upload file to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Right-click file → **Share** → **Copy link**
3. Set permissions to "Anyone with the link"
4. Paste link in Discord

### Dropbox:
1. Upload to [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)
2. Click **Share** → **Create link**
3. Share the link in Discord

### OneDrive:
1. Upload to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.com)
2. Right-click → **Share**
3. Copy and share the link

**Pros:** Files stay available long-term, easy to manage
**Cons:** Uses your cloud storage quota, may require sign-in for recipients

---

## Method 5: Host Files on GitHub (For Code/Projects)

If you're sharing code, projects, or text files with your Discord community:

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository
2. Upload your files
3. Share the repository link or direct file links
4. Recipients can clone/download the entire project

**Best for:** Open-source projects, code sharing, documentation, large text-based files

---

## Method 6: Use Discord Bots (Server Owners)

Some Discord bots can help with file management:

**File.io Bot** - Uploads files to temporary hosting
**Dropbox Bot** - Integrates Dropbox with Discord
**Google Drive Bot** - Links Google Drive files directly

*Note: Requires server admin permissions to add bots*

---

## Special Case: Sending Videos and Images

### For Images:
- Convert PNG to JPG (much smaller)
- Reduce image dimensions if high resolution isn't needed
- Use image compression tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)

### For Videos:
- Reduce resolution (4K → 1080p or 720p)
- Lower frame rate (60fps → 30fps)
- Use efficient codecs (H.265/HEVC)
- Trim unnecessary footage
- See: [How to compress a video for Discord](#)

### For GIFs:
- GIFs are notoriously large. Convert to MP4 instead using [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/gif-to-mp4)
- MP4 videos are typically 10x smaller than GIFs with better quality

## Tips and Best Practices

<Alert>
**Security:**
- Use password protection on sensitive files (most transfer services offer this)
- Share passwords via Discord DMs, not in the same message as the link
- Use end-to-end encrypted services like Transfer.zip for private files
- Be cautious with files from unknown sources
</Alert>

<Tip>
**For Better Experience:**
- **Warn recipients** about large downloads (especially on mobile data)
- **Include file details** in your message: name, size, what it contains
- **Use descriptive filenames** - "ProjectReport_Jan2026.pdf" not "document.pdf"
- **Check file integrity** after splitting/compressing
- **Test the link** before sharing to ensure it works
</Tip>

**Discord Etiquette:**
- Don't spam multiple large file links in quick succession
- Use spoiler tags for NSFW content: `||link||`
- Pin important file links for easy access later
- Delete old/expired links to keep chat clean

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"This file is too large to upload"**
- Try compressing first, then splitting if needed
- Use a file transfer service instead

**"Recipients can't open the file"**
- Ensure all split parts were downloaded (for split archives)
- Check that the file format is supported on their device
- Verify the download link hasn't expired

**"Transfer speed is too slow"**
- Large files take time - be patient
- For instant transfers, use Transfer.zip's P2P mode (streams directly)
- Check your internet connection speed

**"Link expired"**
- Most free services expire links after a few days
- Re-upload and send a new link
- Use services with longer retention (SwissTransfer: 30 days)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I get banned for sharing large files on Discord?**
No, using external links is completely allowed and encouraged by Discord for files over the limit.

**Is it safe to use file transfer services?**
Yes, reputable services like Transfer.zip, SwissTransfer, and WeTransfer are safe. Always use encryption for sensitive files.

**Why doesn't Discord allow larger files for free?**
Server storage and bandwidth are expensive. The 25 MB limit helps Discord manage costs while staying free.

**Can I send large files in Discord DMs?**
Yes, the same 25 MB limit applies. Use the same workarounds mentioned above.

**What's the fastest method?**
Transfer.zip's Quick Transfer (P2P mode) streams files directly without upload waiting time.

## Is Nitro Worth It Just for File Uploads?

Discord Nitro ($9.99/month) raises the limit to **500 MB** and includes:
- Higher quality video streaming
- Custom emojis everywhere
- Profile decorations
- Server boosts

**Worth it if:**
- You frequently share 25-500 MB files
- You want the other Nitro perks
- You use Discord professionally

**Not worth it if:**
- You only occasionally send large files (use free transfer services)
- Your files are usually over 500 MB anyway (you'd still need external services)
- You're on a tight budget

---

**Bottom line:** You don't need Nitro to share large files on Discord. Services like [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip) offer unlimited file sizes for free, with the added benefit of keeping Discord servers lean and fast.
