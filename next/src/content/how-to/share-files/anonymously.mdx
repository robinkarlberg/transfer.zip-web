<TLDR>
Use services with no account requirement, no tracking, and end-to-end encryption.

 **Transfer.zip** (unlimited size, E2E encrypted, *temporary* link)

 Avoid cloud storage giants that require accounts and log metadata, or other file sharing services that compromise on privacy.
</TLDR>

So, how can you share files anonymously and safely now? Let's cover why you might care, what to watch out for, and which tools work well for this.

## Why Someone Cares About Anonymous File Sharing

Maybe you are:
- An activist or journalist wanting to keep sources safe.
- Sending big personal files and don't want companies tracking everything.
- Working in a company where you want to protect sensitive client info.
- Just tired of cookie banners, tracking, or “sign up” popups.

Privacy matters more in 2026 as online tracking is everywhere and file sizes keep growing. People want simple, private, and unlimited ways to send files, without giving something up or dealing with complicated steps.

## Main Ways to Share Files Anonymously

One of the easiest ways today for anonymous sharing is using dedicated services that don't collect your info, don't place tracking cookies, and are built for privacy.

### 1. Transfer.zip
[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip) is a newer, [Open Source](https://github.com/robinkarlberg/transfer.zip-web) service with privacy at the center. Its main strengths:
- **No account needed** for Quick Transfer mode, and no file size limits at all (even 100GB+ is ok).
- **End-to-end encryption**, so only you and your recipient can open the files.
- **No tracking cookies** or forced popups. Your details are not logged.
- **Can send by email or as a private link** that auto-expires. There is also a dashboard for advanced accounts to track link access, but no personal data is shared.
- **Files can be sent directly (Peer-to-Peer)**, meaning nothing is saved on servers if you don't want.

{/* **Weaknesses:** Without an account, files only live as long as your browser tab stays open (for Quick Transfer). For longer storage, a paid plan is needed. */}

### 2. Encrypted Messaging Apps

Some apps like [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) allow files to be sent with end-to-end encryption and no log of your data if you use a burner account or temporary number.

<Pro>Small files (photos, PDFs)</Pro>
<Pro>Chat apps you already use</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor>

### 3. Self-Hosted Solutions

For tech-savvy people, self-hosted options like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) let you control your own file sharing with public links and custom expiry.

<Pro>Total control</Pro>

<BadFor label="Weaknesses:">
<Con>Must run your own server</Con>

### 4. Encrypted USB Sticks and “Sneakernet”

Sometimes digital is too risky, and you transfer files on an encrypted USB stick - good for physical hand-off but not always practical.

## Tips: Keeping File Sharing Anonymous & Secure

**1. Use Encryption:** Always use services that encrypt files before uploading. If possible, encrypt files with your own password before sharing.

**2. Prefer Temporary Links:** Pick services that delete files after a short time or after download.

**3. Avoid Giving Personal Info:** Choose tools that don't need your real email or sign up.

**4. Double-Check URLs:** Make sure you use the official site - fake file transfer pages are common for phishing.

**5. Watch File Size and Limits:** Not all services can handle big video files, but Transfer.zip has no limits on file size.

**6. Audit and Track (If Needed):** Some advanced users want to see if a link was visited. Tools like Transfer.zip's paid plans offer this.

**How do I know if a service is really anonymous?**  
Check their privacy policy, look for “no logging”, “no cookies”, and encryption. Try to confirm with third-party reviews.

**Is it safer to use apps like Signal for files?**  
It is good for privacy but there are file size limits. Not ideal for huge files.
