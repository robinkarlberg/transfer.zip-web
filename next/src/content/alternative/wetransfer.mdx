<TLDR>
WeTransfer's free tier limits you to **3 GB**, with **3 days expiry**, and max **10 transfers**. 

The top alternative is **Transfer.zip**. Chosen based on file size, retention needs, and privacy requirements.
</TLDR>

## Why look beyond WeTransfer?

WeTransfer sparked outrage in mid-July 2025 when it quietly updated its terms of service to allow **training machine learning models** on user-uploaded files. The controversial clause granted the company broad rights to reproduce, modify, and create derivative works from uploaded content.

In addition, WeTransfer's free tier feels tighter every year: the cap is now **3 GB per transfer**, links expire after **3 days**, and since December 2024 you're limited to **10 transfers per month**. If you routinely send RAW photos, 4K footage, or full project folders, those ceilings hurt.

## What we compared

| Key metric | Why it matters |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free-tier size limit** | Tells you whether you can skip chopping or compressing your project. |
| **Retention window** | How long recipients have before the link dies. |
| **Security options** | Passwords or true end-to-end encryption for sensitive work. |
| **Daily / monthly caps** | Some tools throttle how many gigs or transfers you can push. |
| **Ads & UI** | A slick, ad-free landing page looks more professional. |
