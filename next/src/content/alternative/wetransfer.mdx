<TLDR>
WeTransfer's free tier limits you to **3 GB**, with **3 days expiry**, and max **10 transfers per month**. 

The top alternative is **Transfer.zip**. Chosen based on file size, retention needs, and privacy requirements.
</TLDR>

## Why look beyond WeTransfer?

WeTransfer sparked outrage in mid-July 2025 when it quietly updated its terms of service to allow **training machine learning models** on user-uploaded files. The controversial clause granted the company broad rights to reproduce, modify, and create derivative works from uploaded content. Though WeTransfer walked back the changes after public backlash, the incident damaged trust with creative professionals who rely on file transfer services.

In addition, WeTransfer's free tier has become increasingly restrictive: the cap is now **3 GB per transfer**, links expire after **3 days**, and since December 2024 you're limited to **10 transfers per month**. If you routinely send RAW photos, 4K footage, or full project folders, those ceilings hurt.

## 2. Smash - Queue system holds back free users

![A screenshot of the Smash landing page.](/img/content/smash.png)

Smash markets "unlimited" file sizes, but free users sending anything over **2 GB** face an "economy" queue during busy hours, leading to delays of several hours. Paid plans remove the queue and increase limits to **250 GB** (Pro) or **1 TB** (Team).

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Clean UI without ads</Pro>
<Pro>Public API available</Pro>
<Pro>Outlook and Chrome extensions</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">

## 3. 4Shared - Old-school cloud storage with heavy ads

![A screenshot of the 4Shared landing page.](/img/content/4shared.png)

4Shared is primarily a cloud storage service, not a dedicated file transfer tool. Free accounts get **15 GB storage** and **2 GB per file**, but files are deleted after **180 days of inactivity**. Premium ups this to **100 GB storage** and **5 GB per file**, but ads plague the free experience.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Long retention if account stays active</Pro>
<Pro>WebDAV and FTP access</Pro>
<Pro>Social features and collaboration</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">

<Con>Cloud storage model, not transfer-focused</Con>

## 4. TransferNow - EU-hosted with strong privacy

![A screenshot of the TransferNow landing page. It looks kinda cool but cluttered in our opinion.](/img/content/transfernow.png)

TransferNow offers **5 GB** free transfers with **7 days** retention. Paid Premium and Team plans stretch to **250-500 GB** per transfer with up to **365 days** retention. EU-hosted servers and antivirus scanning add security, plus free password protection.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Free password protection</Pro>
<Pro>EU-hosted servers</Pro>
<Pro>Antivirus scanning included</Pro>
<Pro>Up to 365-day retention on paid plans</Pro>

## 5. Send Anywhere - Capped at 50 GB even when paying

![A screenshot of the Send Anywhere landing page.](/img/content/send-anywhere.png)

Send Anywhere's unique selling point is its **6-digit key** system for real-time P2P transfers (up to **50 GB**). However, even paid plans ($5.99-9.99/month) cap link transfers at just **20-30 GB** and impose monthly download limits (200-500 GB).

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Real-time P2P via 6-digit codes</Pro>
<Pro>Cross-platform apps</Pro>
<Pro>Quick device-to-device transfers</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">

## 6. pCloud Transfer - No paid option available

pCloud Transfer is a basic tool, not a comprehensive service. It's permanently locked at **5 GB** with **7-day** retention - even pCloud paying customers can't upgrade transfer limits. For larger files, you'd need a full pCloud storage account (separate pricing).

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Browser-side encryption option</Pro>
<Pro>Clean, ad-free interface</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">
<Con>No paid transfer-specific plans</Con>
<Con>5 GB hard limit for all users</Con>
<Con>Must purchase full cloud storage for larger transfers</Con>
<Con>No business features</Con>
</BadFor>

## 7. FileMail - Unlimited size but expensive

![A screenshot of the FileMail landing page.](/img/content/filemail.png)

FileMail's Pro plan (**$20/month**) allows **250 GB** transfers, while Business and Enterprise plans offer truly unlimited file sizes. UDP acceleration provides faster speeds than browser-based competitors. However, at $20/month minimum, it's among the priciest options for individual users.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>Truly unlimited on Business/Enterprise</Pro>
<Pro>UDP acceleration for speed</Pro>
<Pro>Resumable transfers</Pro>
<Pro>Strong compliance features</Pro>
</GoodFor>

<Con>Free tier heavily restricted (2 transfers/day)</Con>
<Con>Unlimited requires expensive Business plan</Con>
<Con>No password protection on free tier</Con>
</BadFor>

## 8. TransferXL - Daily caps frustrate paid users

TransferXL offers **5 GB** free transfers with a **10 GB daily limit**. Paid plans (€9.99-19.99/month) increase limits to **100-200 GB** but maintain annoying daily and monthly caps. End-to-end encryption is included, but ads clutter the free experience.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>End-to-end encryption by default</Pro>
<Pro>Server location choice (EU/US/Asia)</Pro>
<Pro>Thumbnail previews</Pro>
</GoodFor>
<BadFor label="Cons:">

## 9. SwissTransfer - Free forever, but no upgrade path

![A screenshot of the SwissTransfer landing page. Has looked the same for many years.](/img/content/swiss-transfer.png)

SwissTransfer allows **50 GB** transfers with **30-day** retention under Swiss privacy laws. It's completely free with no paid plans, making it unsuitable for users who need larger files, extended retention beyond 30 days, or business features like branding and analytics.

<GoodFor label="Pros:">
<Pro>50 GB free limit</Pro>
<Pro>30-day retention</Pro>
<Pro>Swiss privacy protection</Pro>
<Pro>Password protection included</Pro>
</GoodFor>

### Choosing the Right WeTransfer Alternative

**If you need:**

1. **Largest files (1 TB)** → Transfer.zip offers the highest limit with 365-day retention
2. **Best value** → Transfer.zip's 7-day free trial and competitive pricing beat WeTransfer Starter ($6.99) and FileMail ($20)
3. **Longest retention** → Transfer.zip (365 days) and TransferNow (365 days)
4. **Truly unlimited** → Transfer.zip P2P (unlimited when expiry = "tab closed") or FileMail Business (expensive)
5. **No queue or delays** → Transfer.zip P2P or paid plans from any service except Smash

**Why Transfer.zip stands out:**
- **7-day free trial** lets you test 1 TB uploads and 365-day retention risk-free
- **Unlimited P2P** for immediate transfers without queues (when expiry set to "tab closed")
- **365-day retention** is the longest available - perfect for client projects
- **1 TB file limit** exceeds WeTransfer Starter (300 GB) and most competitors
- **Open source** means transparent, auditable code
- **Lower cost** than FileMail ($20) with comparable features

**After the AI controversy:**
WeTransfer lost trust with creative professionals in July 2025. Transfer.zip's open-source approach and explicit "your files stay yours" policy offer peace of mind that proprietary services can't match.
